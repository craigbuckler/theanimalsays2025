This organic range of cotton T-shirts for little animal lovers, takes inspiration from the characters from my book ["The Animal Says..."](--ROOT--books/the-animal-says/) More than just clothing, they're storytellers. Each design is chosen to spark fun and creativity in your child's world and available in a range of sizes and colours.

This organic range of cotton clothing for little animal lovers, is inspired by the characters from my book "The Animal Says..." More than just clothing, they're storytellers. Each design has been chosen to spark fun and creativity in your child's world and available in a range of sizes and colours.

All clothing is sustainably made with GOTS certified soft organic cotton and printed using renewable energy in the UK in partnership with Teemill based on the Isle of Wight.

Shipped in eco-friendly packaging, which your children can colour in afterwards. These colourful eco-friendly designs are perfect for playtime, storytime or wild adventures!

## Designed with care

My clothing tells a story and supports a healthier planet by being ethically produced, printed with non toxic, water based inks, and sized for comfort with room to grow.

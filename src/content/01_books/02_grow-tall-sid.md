## "Grow Tall Sid" reviews

> “Grow Tall Sid! is a gem of a book."

> "Debra Wellington has captured the lifecycle of a sunflower beautifully. It's written in an informative way that is fun for the targeted audience. The illustrations are bold, bright and colourful and having them against the white background makes them stand out even more. It's very simple but effective. I love the fact that the cover is glossy but the pages inside have a matt finish."

> "Well written, beautifully illustrated and all round lovely book. 5 out of 5 from me.”

> "Lovely illustrations and very informative text that can be understood by even the youngest child. It follows the progress of Sid the Sunflower seed from being planted, growing, blooming and becoming a wonderful source of food for birds and small animals in autumn. Children from 3 to 8 will absolutely love it. My granddaughter wants the story time and again she loves it so much."

> "Debra Wellington covers the life cycle of a sunflower in this beautifully illustrated book. It is done through an engaging story of Sid a sunflower seed from the moment he is planted. Her illustrations are very reminiscent of Eric Carle. I definitely recommend you buy this book."


### Review by Busy Busy Learning

Learning through creativity, books, and play.

**"Grow Tall Sid!"** is yet another triumph. As with The Animal Says… the letters used on the cover of the book have little eyes peeping out at you. This was one of our favourite features last time as they’re an invitation to come and take a look in the book.

I've likened Debra's artwork to the author and illustrator Eric Carle before and it still has that feel but her rich, warm collages have a growing sense of unique style. In this latest book we get settings for the characters and we adore the textures that almost jump off the page that has been captured in areas such as the soil. This book is one that sparks your creativity and invites you to create your own works of art.

Debra's books are ideal for home yet equally perfect for nurseries and schools. They're books that ignite so many learning opportunities through a range of topics. **"Grow Tall Sid!"** tells the story of little seed Sid who wants to be tall and bright like other flowers. With the help of creatures in the garden Sid blossoms and young readers learn the lifecycle of the sunflower. This is where we see a big difference from the first book, which was non fiction. **"Grow Tall Sid!"** sees her confidently expand into fiction.

Many life cycle books are represented linearly with a beginning and an end , in the case of a sunflower, seed to flower. Debra cleverly completes the circle showing how a flower wilts and returns its seeds to the soil. I think this is such an important connection to overtly make.

The vocabulary in the book has lots to tantalise your taste buds. Words Floss and I particularly loved included, anchored, wilted and snuggling. Our favourite spreads are with the hedgehog and the snail.

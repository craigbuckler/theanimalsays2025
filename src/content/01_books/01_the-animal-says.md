**From Buzz to Zzz...**

My first book **"The Animal Says..."** was published in 2021.

This non-fiction book brings each of my colourful animal illustrations to life with fun facts for young readers. Your children will love making the animal sounds with you, stimulating physical, emotional and cognitive development.

Since my book was published I've visited several schools to read to the children and to tell them all about how the book was published and how I created the colourful illustrations for the book. The book visits are fun and noisy as we all join in with the animal voices, Ribbit! Wheek! Roar!....

**"The Animal Says..."** was a finalist in The Wishing Shelf Book Awards in 2022.

The book is suitable for children aged 0 to 6 years old.

The text is simple enough for young readers and contains information that the children really want to know. That's what I loved, it's not just a story."

### Review by Busy Busy Learning

Learning through creativity, books and play

Let me tell you a little more about this fab little non-fiction text, **"The Animal Says..."**

Firstly, we love the different eyes popping out of the lettering on the front cover inviting you to take a peep inside and discover who is within. The style of illustration draws my mind to those of the incredible Eric Carle; a style so appealing and accessible to children. There’s a fun nature to the design of each character and they’d be an ideal starting point for an art project; something for home or school.

Each spread is for a different animal and has four lines bursting with facts about each creature. Can you guess which animal there is talk of poop!? Kids love poo so much! A great book to introduce children to non-fiction writing. Children could choose their own animal to create and then research and write their facts about. Younger children will love joining in with making the animal noises; this would be an ideal read-aloud for in a classroom or group setting.


## "The animal says..." read using Cued Speech

The charity Cued Speech UK filmed **"The Animal Says..."** using Cued Speech. Cued speech helps deaf people see what you're saying using eight hand shapes in four positions near the mouth which clarifies the lip patterns of speech. All children can enjoy reading the book and learning about the animals.

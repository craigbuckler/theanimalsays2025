**Hello!** I'm Debra Wellington.

<img src="--ROOT--images/debra-wellington.avif" alt="Debra Wellington" width="640" height="657">

I'm a children's author and illustrator from Devon, in the UK. I bring books to life through hand painted collage. Every colourful creature in [my books](--ROOT--books/) is created from painted, printed, and textured papers I've designed and made by hand -- one brushstroke, splatter or scribble at a time.

Paper pieces are cut and assembled into a final scene, filling each book with colour and creativity.

You'll find me in my studio covered in glue and surrounded by a rainbow of paper scraps. My art is all about fun, imagination and the little surprises hiding in every page.

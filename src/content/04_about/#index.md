**Hello!** I'm Debra Wellington.

I'm a children's author and illustrator from Devon, UK who brings books to life through hand painted collage. Every colourful creature in my books is created from painted, printed, and textured papers I've designed and made by hand -- one brushstroke, splatter or scribble at a time.

Paper pieces are cut and assembled into a final scene, filling each book with colour and creativity.

You'll find me in my studio covered in glue and surrounded by a rainbow of paper scraps. My art is all about fun, imagination and the little surprises hiding in every page.
